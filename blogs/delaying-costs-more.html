    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Published on July 1, 2025 • 5 min read</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
      We often postpone investing with the thought: “I’ll start next year when I have more savings.” But what seems like a harmless delay can actually cost you lakhs in the long run.
      In this blog, we’ll break down how compounding works — and why starting early is your biggest financial advantage.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mt-6">🧠 The Power of Compounding</h2>
    <p>
      Compounding means your investment earns interest, and that interest earns more interest over time. The earlier you start, the more time your money gets to grow exponentially.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700 mt-4">📊 Case Study: Riya vs Aman</h3>
    <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow border-l-4 border-blue-500">
      <p class="font-medium text-gray-800">
        Let’s compare two friends:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Riya</strong> starts investing ₹5,000/month at age 25 and stops at age 35.</li>
        <li><strong>Aman</strong> starts investing ₹5,000/month at age 35 and continues till 50.</li>
        <li>Both get an average return of 12% annually.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-4">
      At age 50, here’s what happens:
    </p>

    <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md text-gray-800">
      <p><strong>Riya's Corpus (invested ₹6L):</strong> ₹55.3 Lakhs</p>
      <p><strong>Aman's Corpus (invested ₹9L):</strong> ₹40.6 Lakhs</p>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>Riya invests less, for fewer years — yet ends up with ₹15 lakh more</strong> than Aman. That’s the power of starting early.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mt-6">⏳ The Cost of Waiting Just 5 Years</h2>
    <p>
      Here's what happens if you delay your ₹5,000/month SIP by just 5 years, assuming 12% CAGR over 25 years:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Start at 25:</strong> Corpus = ₹95.4 Lakhs</li>
      <li><strong>Start at 30:</strong> Corpus = ₹53.5 Lakhs</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-2 text-red-600 font-medium">
      That 5-year delay costs you over ₹41 lakh!
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mt-6">🎯 Start Small, Start Now</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t wait for the “perfect time.” Whether it's ₹500 or ₹5,000 a month, what matters most is time in the market — not timing the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you're still paying off loans or just starting your job, start with whatever you can. Gradually increase your SIP as your income grows.

    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mt-10">💡 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Time is your most valuable asset when it comes to investing. Every year you wait, you lose the magic of compounding. Start now — even if it’s small — and let your money work harder than you do.
