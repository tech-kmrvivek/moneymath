      <p class="mb-4">Imagine having the freedom to retire in your 40s or even earlier. That’s the promise of FIRE—Financial Independence, Retire Early. It’s not about giving up work entirely, but having the *freedom* to choose how you spend your time. Let's explore how to achieve it.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">What is FIRE?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">FIRE is a financial movement where individuals aim to save and invest aggressively during their working years to achieve financial independence early in life. Once your investments generate enough passive income to cover your living expenses, you’re considered financially independent.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Core Principles of FIRE</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>High Savings Rate:</strong> Many FIRE followers save 50–70% of their income.</li>
        <li><strong>Frugal Lifestyle:</strong> Keeping expenses low helps you reach your goal faster.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Investing:</strong> Most use index funds, mutual funds, or real estate to grow their wealth.</li>
        <li><strong>Passive Income Focus:</strong> Build assets that generate cash flow even when you're not working.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">How Much Do You Need?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A common rule of thumb is the <strong>25x rule</strong>: Multiply your expected annual expenses by 25 to calculate your FIRE target. For example, if you plan to spend ₹6 lakh per year, you’ll need ₹1.5 crore to retire early.</p>

        <li><strong>Fat FIRE:</strong> More luxurious lifestyle without frugality constraints.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Challenges You May Face</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Your corpus must grow faster than inflation to sustain early retirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Early retirees need to plan for out-of-pocket medical expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> Your portfolio must survive market ups and downs over decades.</li>
      </ul>
