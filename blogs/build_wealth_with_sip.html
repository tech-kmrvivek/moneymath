    <p class="mb-4">Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) have become a popular method for investing in mutual funds, especially for salaried individuals and those who prefer disciplined investing. But how exactly do SIPs help build wealth over time? Let's break it down.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">What is a SIP?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">A SIP is a method of investing a fixed amount in a mutual fund at regular intervals (monthly or quarterly). Instead of timing the market, SIPs help you invest consistently, no matter the market condition.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">The Power of Compounding</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">One of the biggest advantages of SIPs is compounding. When your investments earn returns, and those returns are reinvested, you begin to earn "returns on returns". Over time, this can lead to exponential growth in your wealth.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Benefits of SIPs</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Rupee Cost Averaging:</strong> You buy more units when the market is low and fewer when it's high, averaging out the cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Regular investing builds good financial habits.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can start with as little as ₹500/month and increase gradually.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Focus:</strong> SIPs help you stay invested without worrying about short-term volatility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Example: How SIP Builds Wealth</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Let’s say you invest ₹10,000 every month for 20 years with an average return of 12% per annum. Your total investment would be ₹24 lakhs, but your wealth would grow to over ₹99 lakhs due to compounding!</p>

      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start early. The longer you stay invested, the more powerful compounding becomes.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">SIP vs Other Investment Modes</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Unlike fixed deposits or one-time investments, SIPs offer growth potential while keeping risk manageable. They’re also automated, removing the stress of manual investing each month.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Who Should Invest via SIP?</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
      <li>Young professionals looking to build wealth gradually</li>
      <li>Anyone with regular income and long-term goals</li>
      <li>Investors who want to reduce timing risk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">SIPs are an excellent tool for building wealth over time. They harness the power of compounding, reduce market timing risk, and promote disciplined investing. Start today—even small amounts can grow big if you give them enough time!</p>
