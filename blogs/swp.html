    <p class="mb-4">Are you looking for a steady source of income from your investments? A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) could be the right financial strategy for you.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">What is SWP?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">A Systematic Withdrawal Plan is a facility offered by mutual funds that allows investors to withdraw a fixed amount from their investment at regular intervals—monthly, quarterly, or annually. Instead of getting returns in lump sum, SWP provides a controlled and consistent cash flow.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Why Choose SWP?</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Regular Income:</strong> Ideal for retirees or those looking for monthly income.</li>
      <li><strong>Customizable:</strong> You can choose the withdrawal amount and frequency.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Efficiency:</strong> Compared to interest from fixed deposits, capital gains from SWP can be more tax-efficient, especially in equity mutual funds held long-term.</li>
      <li><strong>Wealth Preservation:</strong> Since only a part of the investment is withdrawn, the remaining corpus continues to earn returns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">How It Works</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Let’s say you have ₹10 lakh invested in a mutual fund. You set an SWP of ₹10,000 monthly. Every month, units worth ₹10,000 are sold, and the money is transferred to your account. The rest of your investment continues to grow based on the market performance.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Consider These Factors</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Withdrawal Rate:</strong> Make sure your withdrawal amount doesn’t deplete your corpus too soon.</li>
      <li><strong>Market Conditions:</strong> In a falling market, selling units regularly can erode your portfolio value faster.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Over time, inflation can reduce your purchasing power. Consider increasing the withdrawal amount annually to maintain the same lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">SWP is a great tool for generating a reliable income stream while maintaining the growth potential of your investment. It's especially suitable for those in retirement or anyone seeking passive income.</p>
